There're five branches in total, you can view my solution to each lab by simply differentiate the branches.

The master branch is the INITIAL state of upstream, and the four other branches `lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3` and `lab4`, respectively, are my solution to the four labs.

For example in order to view my solution to lab1 just type `git diff master lab1`.
